---+!! ClassificationPlugin
%TOC%

---++ Description
ClassificationPlugin is a taxonomy and folksonomy extension for Foswiki that allows you to 
manage knowledge assets stored in your wiki. Users can organize their content by filing 
topics into categories and by adding offhand tags. Classifying content using categories and tags
are the key factors to foster sustainable knowledge management. This becomes even more important
in a wiki environment where content is created quickly but has to be made available for a longer period of time.

Categories become the backbone spanning all of your content. Content can then be retrieved by browsing
categories narrowing down search results interactively in addition to the normal full-text search.

---++ Key features 
*Multilevel facet navigation*: Wiki content is displayed dynamically by browsing a category tree or 
by means of interactive tag clouds. 

*Managing taxonomies the wiki way*: Categories in a taxonomy are first-class wiki citizens that can be created,
renamed, managed and reused as easily as normal wiki topics.

*Expressive knowledge models*: Categories may form poly-hierarchies
where categories can have multiple parent categories. Wiki documents can be filed into multiple
categories at the same time.

*Multidimensional classification*: A wiki document may participate in multiple taxonomies and folksonomies
at the same time. Different facets of a document can be separated in a clean way.

*Reusing and merging taxonomies*: A category tree once defined in one web space can be imported into another
web space effortless. You are free to chose which part of a tree you want to import. Multiple category trees
from a number of web spaces can be merged and reassembled differently in a new web. That way predefined
taxonomies can be managed in a centralized way and reused as needed in different webs. Any change to a taxonomy
in one place will automatically show up in all webs that imported it.

*Tagging for corporate intranets*: While categories establish a predefined vocabulary, tags are a way to
assign keywords to wiki content in an ad hoc fashion. This completes category knowledge management in
a natural and fruitful way.

*Standardized <nop>WikiApplicatons*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin conforms to the <nop>WikiWorkbench application
framework that grants for scalable and long-term maintainable <nop>WikiApplications.

*Extensibility*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin serves as a building block for further <nop>WikiApplications
to be integrated in an overall knowledge management infrastructure. It serves as a middleware for a couple
of higher order applications, like blogging, forums and skills management available separately.

*Document types*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin adds a couple of document types to the standard set that come with
the <nop>WikiWorkbench. This gives you maximum flexibility in your knowledge management initiative. Further
document types can be derived with ease. These will automatically participate in the overall knowledge management
framework.

*Facetted Search*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin integrates well into [[Foswiki:Extensions/SolrPlugin][SolrPlugin]] using tags and 
categories to drill down into search results.

---++ Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to create a new web by using the =_ClassificationTemplate= web as a template. For this

   1 go to [[System.WebCreateNewWeb]] (or [[System.ManagingWebs]] in case you are not using [[Foswiki:Extensions/NatSkin][NatSkin]])
   2 enter the name of your new web, e.g. "Knowledge"
   4 select =_ClassificationTemplate= as a template web
   5 click Submit

This will create a new web called "Knowledge" which has got all the means preinstalled to create content under the control of the ClassificationPlugin such as:

   * create new categories on the <nop>Knowledge.Category topic
   * create new categorizable and taggable content either using the <nop>Knowledge.ClassifiedTopic form or by hitting the "New" button on the top of each button

Customize the frontpage of the new "Knowledge" web by describing the key content and thematic fields stored in it as well as their use.
Note that for best findability it is recommended to install [[Foswiki:Extensions/SolrPlugin][SolrPlugin]] along with ClassificationPlugin. <nop>SolrPlugin will
be able to automatically generate recommended links to similar content in your "Knowledge" web based on category and tagging meta data. It also lets you
filter and trim down search results selecting tags and categories in use.

---++ The <nop>ClassificationApp

ClassificationPlugin is based on the [[Foswiki:Extensions/WikiWorkbenchContrib][WikiWorkbench application framework]] as well as being a base for further
wiki applications build with ClassificationPlugin itself. It has been used to build more specific apps such as 

   * contacts management
   * skills management
   * invoicing 
   * data center management

where categories and tags play a gluing role to extract and link together <nop>TopicTypes from various domains. In all of these cases custom <nop>TopicTypes have been
implemented by extending the types coming with the ClassificationPlugin. By standardizing these applications using the <nop>WikiWorkbench approach and using the
<nop>ClassificationApp as a building block, developing wiki apps has reached a new level being long-term maintainable, reusable, extensible and flexible as proven
in many real-live corporate intranets.

ClassificationPlugin plays a central role in rolling out a unified knowledge management undertaking that covers very different kinds of content with varying data models.

For more details see the [[Applications.ClassificationApp.WebHome][ClassificationApp]] itself.

---++ Macros

---+++ HIERARCHY

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =[web]= | web for which to render the hierarchy for | base web |
| =top= | category within the hierarchy to start decending down the hierarchy | <nop>TopCategory |
| =sort= | sort categories on each step of the hierarchy according to the given property; possible values: =order=, =name=, =title=, =ordertitle=; \
          =order= refers to the <nop>Order formfield of a category that can be used to influence sorting manually; \
          sorting categories by =order= ignores their lexical order as would be the case using =title=; \
          sorting by =ordertitle= first reads the Order property of a category and then falls back to lexical order | =ordertitle= |
| =header= | string to be prepended to categories | |
| =format= | string to be used to render a category | <verbatim><ul>
  <li>
    <img src="$icon" /> 
    <a href="$url">$title</a> 
    $children
  </li>
</ul></verbatim> | 
| =topformat= | format to be used by the =top= category | same as =format= |
| =nullformat= | format to be used when no category was found in the =web= | |
| =separator= | string to be inserted between categories rendered using =format= | |
| =footer= | footer string appended to categories | |
| =placeholder= | string to be used for the =$children= variable when a category has no children | (empty string) |
| =indent= | indentation string used for the =$indent= variable | '   ' (three spaces) |
| =mindepth= | minimum depth from which to start rendering categories | 0 |
| =depth= | maximum depth traversing the hierarchy | 0 (infinite) |
| =matchattr= | which attribute of a category to be used sorting the hierarchy; possible values: =name=, =title= | =name= |
| =matchcase= | case sensitivity sorting categories reading =matchattr= | =on= |
| =exclude= | regular expression to filter out categories reading =matchattr= |  |
| =include= | regular expression to filter out non-matching categories |  |
| =filter= | filter expression when counting topics subsumed by a category |  |
| =unique= | if switched on a category will only be listed once if found in multiple places within the hierarchy | off |
| =open= | list of category names to be considered =open= and which are traversed further down the hierarchy | by default all categories are considered "open" | 
| =hideclosed= | if switched on all "closed" categories, i.e. those not listed in =open= are hidden/not rendered | off |
| =hidenull= | if switched on categories with no topis in them will be hidden | off |
| =nrleafs= | counts of leaf nodes of a category; this value is normally computed automatically; you might use this parameter when counts for are available using different means; format: =cat:count, cat:count, ...= ; | (computed automatically) |
| =nrtopics= | counts of all topics subsumed by a category; like =nrleafs= this value is normally compuited automatically; format: =cat:count, cat:count, ...= |  |

Format strings such as =header=, =footer=, and =format= may contain the following variables:

| *Variable* | *Description* |
| =$breadcrumbs= | comma separated list of categories from the top category down to the current one; note that this is a simplified linear representation of the category's location not taking multile parents into account |
| =$call= | number of iteration steps performed while expanding the %HIERARCHY macro |
| =$count= | number of topics subsumed by a category; see =nrtopics= above |
| =$cyclic= | boolean flag indicating whether the current category is part of a cycle in the hierarchy, which normally indicates a configuration error |
| =$depth= | distance of the current category to the top category |
| =$icon= | image url of the icon of the current category |
| =$id= | id of the category within the hierarchy |
| =$indent= | indentation string; this variable expands to the =indent= parameter times the depth of the current category |
| =$index= | index of the current category among its siblings |
| =$isexpanded= | boolean flag indicating whether the current category is "open" or "closed"; see the =open= and =hideclosed= parameter above |
| =$leafs= | number of leaf nodes of the current category; see also the =nrleafs= parameter |
| =$link= | render anchor markup to render a link to the current category; see also =$url= |
| =$name= | topic name of the current category; this value is unique within a hierarchy |
| =$order= | Order property of a category |
| =$origweb= | originating web where the category was defined; this value might differ from =$web= in case the hierarchy has been (partially) imported from another web |
| =$parents= | comma separated list of parent categories |
| =$siblings= | number of sibling nodes |
| =$subcats= | number of subordinated categories |
| =$summary= | Summary property of a category |
| =$tags= | Tag property of a category |
| =$title= | <nop>TopicTitle property |
| =$topic= | topic name of a category (alias for =$name=) |
| =$trunctitle= | title of a category with the parent topic's title removed from the prefix if found |
| =$url= | url to the current category |
| =$web= | web of the current hierarchy; see also =$origweb= |

---+++ ISA
Predicate that checks if a topic is filed in a specific category or one of its subcategories
and either returns =1= or =0=.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =[topic]=  | the topic to look up | current base topic |
| =web= | the web that holds the hierarchy of categories to use | current base web |
| =cat= | a category or a comma separated list of multiple categories | =TopCategory= |

Categories listed in the =cat= parameter are checked in the given order. %ISA returns
=1= for the first category found that "contains" =topic=.


---+++ SUBSUMES
Predicate that checks if a category is a parent category of another
and either returns =1= or =0=.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =[_anonymous]= | a category name at an upper level of the hierarchy | current base topic |
| =cat= | a category or a comma separated list of multiple categories | |
| =web= | the web that holds the hierarchy of categories to use | current base web |

The macro tests all categories listed in =cat= and returns =1= if at least one of them
is being subsumbed.

Example:

<verbatim class="tml">
%SUBSUMES{"CorporateCategory" cat="CustomerCategory, HumanResourcesCategory"}%
</verbatim>

Hierarchy:

   * <nop>CorporateCategory
      * ...
      * <nop>ProductsCategory
      * <nop>CustomerCategory
      * ...
   * <nop>DepartmentsCategory
      * ...
      * <nop>HumanResourcesCategory
      * ...

The result is =1= because <nop>CorporateCategory subsumes <nop>CustomerCategory even though
it doesn subsume <nop>HumanResourcesCategory.

---+++ DISTANCE
A function that returns the numerical distance of two categories or topics being located
in a shared hierarchy. This macro reads the distance matrix being calculated internally
that caches the network topology of the hierarchy. Both, the %ISA as well as %SUBSUMES macro
are based on distance properties of the items being compared.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =[from]= | the starting point where to start measuring from; this can be a category or a topic | current base topic |
| =to= | the end point to measure the distance; this can be a category or a topic | =TopCategory= |
| =abs= | boolean flag to switch on/off absolute distances; if switched =off= results can be negative as well given the order endpoints are specified in =from= and =top= | =off= |
| =web= | the web that holds the hierarchy to use | current base web |
| =format= | format string | =$dist= |
| =undef= | format string that will be returned in case =from= or =to= weren't found or aren't connected at all | (empty string) |

The distance is defined as follows:

   * return =0= if =from= equals =to=
   * returns the minimum number of nodes including the =to= node to get from category =from= to category =to=
   * if =from= is a topic (not a category) the result is decreased by one
   * if =to= is a topic (not a category) the result is increased by one
   * if =from= and =to= are not connected the result is =undef=
   * if =from= is located "higher" in the hierarchy than =to= the result is negative unless =abs= has been set to =on=

When either =from= or =to= are topics (not a category) then the _set_ of categories they are filed into
are taken into consideration to compute the minimum distance. 

---+++ CATINFO
Render category information for a given category or topic.

The macro either operates in "cat mode" or "topic mode" when either the =topic= or the =cat= parameter
has been specified. In "cat mode" the macro returns information about this one category. In "topic mode"
it returns information about all categories the topic is filed into.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =[topic]= | the topic to return category information for | |
| =cat= | a category to return information for; note that =topic= and =cat= are exclusive; you can only specify one of them | |
| =format= | format string to render category information; see the list of possible variables below | =$link= |
| =separator= | format string used to separate list items | =, = (coma + blank) |
| =header= | header string prepended to the result | (empty string) |
| =footer= | footer string appended to the result | (empty string) |
| =web= | the web that holds the hierarchy to use | current base web |
| =subsumes= | only return info about categories subsumed by this category | =TopCategory= |
| =parentsubsumes= | only return info about parent categories subsumbed by this category | =TopCategory= |
| =sortchildren= | switch on/off sorting of returned childdren | =off= |
| =maxchildren= | maximum number of children to return info about; =0= means no limit | =0= |
| =morechildren= | in case more than =maxchildren= items have been found, insert this format string to indicate that there are more | (empty string) |
| =hidenull= | hide children that have no leafs | =off= |
| =null= | format string to be returned in case the category or topic wasn't found | (empty string) |
| =exclude= | regular expression to filter out non-matching categories | |
| =include= | regular expression to that matching categories must match | |
| =matchattr= | attribute of a category to test =exclude= and =include= against; possible values are =name= and =title= | =name= |
| =matchcase= | boolean flag indicating the case sensitivity of the =include= and =exclude= match operation | =on= |
| =truncate= | regular expression to be removed from from the =$title= variable and stored in the =$trunctitle= variable to be used in the =format= string | |
| =limit= | maximum number of categories to process; =0= means all | =0= |
| =skip= | number of categories to skip while rendering results; this parameter allows to implement paging together with =limit= | =0= |

The =format=, =header= and =footer= parameter know the following variables:

| *Variable* | *Description* |
| =$breadcrumb=, =$breadcrumbs= | breadcrumb list of links to parent categories |
| =$breadcrumbnames= | breadcrumb list of parent category names |
| =$breadcrumbtitles= | breadcrumb list of parent category titles |
| =$children=, =childrenlinks? | list links to children |
| =$childrenname= | list of child names |
| =$childrentitle= | list of child titles |
| =$childrenurls= | list of child urls |
| =$count= | number of categories found |
| =$cyclic= | returns =0= or =1= depending on the category being part of a cycle or not |
| =$icon= | url to icon representing the category |
| =$index= | running number of all categories being formated |
| =$leafs= | number of leaf nodes of the current category |
| =$link= | link to the current category as an html anchor |
| =$more= | expands to the =morechildren= parameter in case =maxchildren= has been reached |
| =$name=, =$topic= | name of the current category |
| =$order= | order of the current category |
| =$origweb= | original web where the current category has been defined; this might differ from =$web= when part of the hierarchy including this category has been imported from another web |
| =$parentitles= | list of titles of the parent categories |
| =$parentlinks=, =$parent=, =$parents=  | list of links to the parent categories |
| =$parentnames= | list of names of the parent categories |

| =$url= | url to the currrent category |
| =$web= | web where this category is being located (see also =$origweb=) |


---+++ TAGINFO
Render tag information for a given category or topic.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =[topic]= | topic for which to render tag information | =%!BASETOPIC%= |
| =format= | format string to render tag information; see the list of possible variables below | =$title= |
| =separator= | format string used to separate list items | =, = (coma + blank) |
| =header= | header string prepended to the result | (empty string) |
| =footer= | footer string appended to the result | (empty string) |
| =web= | web of the topic, note that this might also be specified in the =topic= parameter | =%!BASEWEB%= |
| =exclude= | regular expressions to filter out tags | |
| =include= | regular expression that tags must match to be rendered | |
| =limit= | maximum number of tags to show | |
| =skip= | number of tags to skip in the list of tags to be rendered | |

---+++ SIMILARTOPICS

<div class="foswikiWarningMessage">
Warning: You are strongly encouraged to use =%SOLRSIMILAR= feature of [[Foswiki:Extensions/SolrPlugin][SolrPlugin]]
for better performance and flexibility.
</div>

Returns a list of topics that are similar to the current one. Similarity between two
topics is a value expressed in percentage, where 100% means that the topics are extremely
similar and 0% means that the compared topics aren't corelated at all. The similarity
is computed on the base of the categorization and tagging information using a
weighted matching coefficient.

---++ Integration into query language 

ClassificationPlugins adds three new operators to the query language to make use of category information in wiki applications.
Note however that for now only the =%DBQUERY= language is supported (see [[Foswiki:Extensions/DBCachePlugin][DBCachePlugin]]).

| *Operator* | *Description* | 
| =cat1 SUBSUMES cat2= | returns true when =cat1= subsumes =cat2= | 
| =topic ISA cat= | returns true when =topic= is covered by =cat= | 
| =catOrTopic DISTANCE catOrTopic= | returns the distance between two categories, a category and a topic or two topics within the context of the same hierarchy; see the above definition of the [[#DISTANCE][%DISTANCE]] macro |
